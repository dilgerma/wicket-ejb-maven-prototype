This is a simple Demo Application to play around with different
technologies like EJB3, Spring, Wicket, Maven, Scala, OSGi etc.,
feel free to supply patches and ideas to martin.dilger@pentasys.de

Currently I use the following Technologies:
Maven2 as Build Tool
Glassfish as Application Server
EJB3 for Middletier
Spring 2.5 as the Connector Technology (so I can run the application presentation within a tomcat that runs against some mocks)
Wicket as Presentation Framework
Scala for Unit Testing (not yet, but planned)

Technical Infos:
The deployed EAR gets mounted in the context "me"
To start the glassfish database, create a Connection-Pool called "Wicket-DS" and a JDBC DataSource
called "jdbc/Wicket-DS", start the Database with "./asadmin start-database"
